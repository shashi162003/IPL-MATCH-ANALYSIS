# IPL Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) match data using Python and various data science libraries. It explores match trends, team performances, toss decisions, winning margins, and other insights from the dataset.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Insights into team performances, toss decisions, and match outcomes.
- Visualizations to represent trends and patterns in IPL matches.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset (`matches.csv`) contains IPL match details such as teams, venues, toss results, match results, winning margins, and player performances.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook IPL_Data_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Teams winning the toss and their decisions (bat/field).
- Win margins (by runs/wickets) for various teams.
- Performance analysis of teams across different seasons.
- Top players with most 'Player of the Match' awards.
